# Crime Intelligence System

An end-to-end applied machine learning project to analyze and predict crime case resolution using Indian crime data (2020–2024).

## Key Features
- Structured EDA with hypothesis testing
- Leakage-safe feature engineering
- Baseline ML model (Logistic Regression)
- Interaction-driven reasoning
- Reproducible ML pipeline
- Application-level prediction demo

## ML Task
Binary classification: Predict whether a crime case will be closed.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Results
- Balanced dataset (~50% closure rate)
- No single dominant predictor
- ML justified due to multivariate interactions

## Future Work
- Tree-based models
- SHAP explainability
- Streamlit dashboard
- AI-generated case summaries
